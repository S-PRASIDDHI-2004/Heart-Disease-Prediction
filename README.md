# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques has gained significant attention due to its potential to improve early detection and prevention of cardiovascular issues. By analyzing medical data, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant parameters, machine learning models can forecast the likelihood of an individual having heart disease. Several studies have explored the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms, including random forest, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and gradient boosting, in accurately predicting heart disease. Optimization techniques, such as rule-generation algorithms and hyperparameter tuning, have been employed to enhance prediction accuracy. The goal is to develop robust prediction models that can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, identifying individuals at risk, and providing timely interventions to prevent or manage heart disease. The research aims to save lives, reduce the economic burden, and improve patient outcomes associated with heart disease.
